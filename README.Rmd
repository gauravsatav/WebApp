## Purpose

This is my attempt at building up a simple R Web Application and upload it on `shinyapps.io`.

The application can is accessible [here](https://gauravsatav.shinyapps.io/WebApp/).

The application uses the data present in the `./Data` and after reading it using `read.csv` we plot a simple histogram taking input dynamically from the slider.
